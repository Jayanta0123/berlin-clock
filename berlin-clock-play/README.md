# berlin-clock-play

This is a simple play app, created from the [Scala Play started project](https://playframework.com/download#starters) that shows a simple web app page with a berlin clock.
It has been inspired by the kata [Scala Tutorial Through Katas: Berlin Clock (Easy)](https://technologyconversations.com/2014/01/13/scala-tutorial-through-katas-berlin-clock-easy/)

## Berlin clock

The Berlin Uhr (Clock) is a rather strange way to show the time.
On the top of the clock there is a yellow lamp that blinks on/off every two seconds.
The time is calculated by adding rectangular lamps.

The top two rows of lamps are red. These indicate the hours of a day. In the top row there are 4 red lamps.
Every lamp represents 5 hours. In the lower row of red lamps every lamp represents 1 hour.
So if two lamps of the first row and three of the second row are switched on that indicates 5+5+3=13h or 1 pm.

The two rows of lamps at the bottom count the minutes. The first of these rows has 11 lamps, the second 4.
In the first row every lamp represents 5 minutes.
In this first row the 3rd, 6th and 9th lamp are red and indicate the first quarter, half and last quarter of an hour.
The other lamps are yellow. In the last row with 4 lamps every lamp represents 1 minute.

The lamps are switched on from left to right.

Y = Yellow
R = Red
O = Off

## Running

Run this using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).  If you downloaded this project from http://www.playframework.com/download then you'll find a prepackaged version of sbt in the project directory:

```
sbt run
```

And then go to http://localhost:9000 to see the running web application.

There are several demonstration files available in this template.

## Controllers

- HomeController.scala:

  Shows how to handle simple HTTP requests.

- AsyncController.scala:

  Shows how to do asynchronous programming when handling a request.

- CountController.scala:

  Shows how to inject a component into a controller and use the component when
  handling requests.

## Components

- Module.scala:

  Shows how to use Guice to bind all the components needed by your application.

- Counter.scala:

  An example of a component that contains state, in this case a simple counter.

- ApplicationTimer.scala:

  An example of a component that starts when the application starts and stops
  when the application stops.
